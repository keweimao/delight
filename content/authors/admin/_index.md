I am passionate about working with data at extreme scales, and my ultimate research goal is to understand what information is and how to quantify meaning from massive, messy data. My research has been focused on large-scale information retrieval (IR) systems and data-intensive processes in distributed settings. I have worked on various projects related to decentralized search, distributed computing for text processing, machine learning, complex networks/systems, and information theoretic modeling.
