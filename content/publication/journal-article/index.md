abstract: With the ubiquitous production, distribution and consumption of information, today's digital environments such as the Web are increasingly large and decentralized. It is hardly possible to obtain central control over information collections and systems in these environments. Searching for information in these information spaces has brought about problems beyond traditional boundaries of information retrieval (IR) research. This article addresses one important aspect of scalability challenges facing information retrieval models and investigates a decentralized, organic view of information systems pertaining to search in large-scale networks. Drawing on observations from earlier studies, we conduct a series of experiments on decentralized searches in large-scale networked information spaces. Results show that how distributed systems interconnect is crucial to retrieval performance and scalability of searching...

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We study decentralized searches in large-scale information networks and discover the phenomenon of Clustering Paradox, that is, how distributed system interconnect and cluster imposes a limit on search performance and scalability.
